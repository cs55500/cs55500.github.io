## Course Description

The field of cryptography gives us a technical language to define important real-world problems such as security, privacy and integrity, a mathematical toolkit to construct mechanisms such as encryption, digital signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation, and a complexity-theoretic framework to prove security using reductions. Together, they help us enforce the rules of the road in digital interactions.

The last few years have witnessed dramatic developments in the foundations of cryptography, as well as its applications to real-world privacy and security problems. For example, cryptography is abuzz with solutions to long-standing open problems such as fully homomorphic encryption and software obfuscation that use an abundance of data for public good without compromising security.

The course will explore the rich theory of cryptography all the way from the basics to the recent developments.

## Prerequisites

This is a fastâ€‘paced graduate course. You should be fluent in algorithms, complexity theory, and discrete probability, and comfortable writing mathematical proofs.

## Collaboration Policy
Collaboration is permitted and encouraged in small groups of at most three students. You are free to collaborate in discussing answers, but you must write up solutions on your own, and must specify in your submission the names of any collaborators. Do not copy any text from your collaborators; the writeup must be entirely your work. Do not write down solutions on a board and copy it verbatim into Latex; again, the writeup must be entirely your own words and your own work and should demonstrate clear understanding of the solution. Additionally, you may make use of published material, provided that you acknowledge all sources used. Of course, scavenging for solutions from prior years is forbidden.
